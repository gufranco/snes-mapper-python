"""Cartridges their owner supplies, identified before any of them is read.

The corpus beside this is a recording. This is what the recording was taken from:
a retail library, walked whole, every header read and checked against what the
model says it is. A corpus proves the model has not drifted since it was recorded.
Only the library proves the recording was right in the first place.

Every file is checked against all four of its digests rather than only the one that
decides. A file can be the right length under the right name and still be a bad
dump, and a manifest that publishes a crc32 beside a sha256 and then never looks at
the crc32 is publishing decoration.

Only retail releases are listed. A modified release, a translation and a prototype
can each carry an edited header, and a header read out of one describes somebody's
edit rather than a cartridge that was manufactured.

Nothing here carries any part of a cartridge. A name, a length and four digests are
measurements, and a digest reconstructs nothing.
